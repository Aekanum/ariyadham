# ===== SPRINT PLANNING SUMMARY =====
# Total Epics: 8
# Total Stories: 39
# Stories by Epic:
#   - Epic 1: 6 stories (Foundation)
#   - Epic 2: 4 stories (Authentication)
#   - Epic 3: 4 stories (Reader)
#   - Epic 4: 4 stories (Author CMS)
#   - Epic 5: 4 stories (Community)
#   - Epic 6: 5 stories (Admin)
#   - Epic 7: 4 stories (Performance)
#   - Epic 8: 5 stories (i18n/Accessibility)
#
# Recommended Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2):
#   - Epic 1: ALL 6 stories (Foundation must complete first)
#   - Epic 2: Stories 2.1-2.2 (Profile & Roles, prerequisite for later features)
#   - Epic 3: Story 3.1 (Reader interface for users to test)
#
# Recommended Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4):
#   - Epic 2: Stories 2.3-2.4 (Author Approval, Settings)
#   - Epic 3: Stories 3.2-3.4 (Browse, Search, SEO)
#
# Development Notes:
# - Start with Epic 1 immediately (foundation blocks everything)
# - Stories 1.1 (Setup) is the absolute first story - initializes project
# - Epics 7-8 (Performance/i18n) should have continuous integration throughout
# - Stories can be worked in parallel once Epic 1 is complete
# - Each story completion should trigger a story-done workflow to update status
